# Medieval 2D dungeon game
If you're wondering what this game is like, think Mario, but he has a battleaxe and lives in the 1400s. This dungeon game is my first experiment with the HTML canvas and game design, and its main purpose is to test and expand my JavaScript skills. I wrote it in ES6 using Babel and Webpack. The game is currently a work in progress.
